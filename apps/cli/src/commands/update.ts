/**
 * `xplainer update` — reconcile this machine with the version of xplainer it has.
 *
 * **It does not replace the package, and that is a decision rather than an omission.** Spawning a
 * package manager from here would rewrite the files this process is executing: survivable on macOS
 * and Linux, where the running inode outlives the unlink, and a failure on Windows, where the
 * package is locked while it runs. The manager is also only knowable for a global npm install —
 * a pnpm, bun or yarn global differs, and an `npx -y xplainer` invocation has nothing installed to
 * update at all. So this reads the registry, says whether a newer version exists, and prints the
 * one command for the install it can actually identify.
 *
 * What it *does* own is the half that is safe and that people forget: after an upgrade, `setup` may
 * need to acquire something the new version wants, and `connect` has to be re-run or the agent keeps
 * yesterday's MCP entry and yesterday's `SKILL.md`. Both are idempotent, both report what changed,
 * and neither is obvious from the upgrade command alone — which is the whole reason this command
 * exists.
 *
 * **The steps are spawned rather than imported.** `commands/setup.ts` and `commands/connect.ts` are
 * orchestration-heavy, and calling into their internals would mean either refactoring both or
 * reimplementing a subset here that drifts the first time either changes. A child process running
 * this same binary cannot drift: whatever `xplainer setup` does today is what this runs.
 *
 * **It is `update`, not `self-update`, and it is deliberately not `daemon update`.** That verb
 * already means something precise — switch the installed daemon to another staged runtime and roll
 * back if it will not start — and this touches neither the supervisor nor the payload. A machine
 * with a daemon still runs `daemon update` for that.
