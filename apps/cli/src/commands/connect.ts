/**
 * `xplainer connect` — point an agent client at this daemon.
 *
 * Three verbs, one entry. Claude, Codex and Copilot differ only in *where* a configuration lives
 * and *who* is allowed to write it; what gets written is the same stdio command line for all three,
 * produced by `connect/entry.ts` and never by an individual writer
 * ([ADR 0020](../../../../docs/adr/0020-always-running-local-daemon.md) §The agent path is IPC, not
 * TCP: "No URL and no token enter any agent configuration file").
 *
 * **Every run starts by proving there is a daemon — except the one that is offered when there is
 * none.** ADR 0020 §Ordering — "`connect` refuses to write an agent configuration pointing at a
 * daemon that has never answered (`--force` overrides). A working-looking config for a daemon that
 * is not running is the single most likely first-run support ticket" — and the proof is
 * `daemon.json`'s recorded port, read through `connect/preflight.ts`. The port is *not* written
 * anywhere; it is read so that this command cannot be assuming `8787`, and printed so that a user
 * on a machine with two daemons can see which one they just connected to.
 *
 * **`--spawn` writes the other entry, and bypasses that check.** It is what ADR 0020 §Degraded
 * paths prints first in both no-supervisor cases, so it is offered at exactly the moment no daemon
 * exists and `daemon install` has just refused; applying the preflight to it would make the
 * remediation refuse itself. What it writes is `xplainer mcp` **without** `--attach` — the eight
 * tools in the agent's own session, no supervision, no shared queue — and `connect/spawn.ts` is
 * where that entry and its extra fallback are decided. All three verbs carry it: the remediation
 * ADR 0020 prints names `claude` because that is the example it is written around, and Codex or
 * Copilot users on the same supervisor-less machine have the same problem and the same answer.
 *
 * **The exit codes are the table's** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6): `3` for a precondition that is not
 * met, with nothing written — no daemon has ever bound here, or the file to edit cannot be
 * understood; `1` for a usage error, such as a scope this command cannot write without the vendor's
 * own CLI; `11` for a `daemon.json` that exists and cannot be read; and `70` for anything else,
 * including a vendor's own `mcp add` that failed for its own reasons.
 *
 * **Each verb prefers the vendor's writer and falls back to a file.** `claude mcp add`,
 * `codex mcp add` and `copilot mcp add` are delegated to when that binary is on `PATH`; the direct
 * writers are for a machine where it is not, and — on the Codex side — for a `--config <path>` that
 * its CLI has no way to be aimed at. Which branch ran is printed either way, because "it worked"
 * and "which file changed" are different questions.
 *
 * **This is not an agent-facing entry**, so unlike `commands/mcp.ts` it writes its summary to
 * stdout. Nothing spawns `connect` and reads its stdout as a protocol.
