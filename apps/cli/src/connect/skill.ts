/**
 * The other half of what `connect` writes: the skill an agent reads before it drives the tools.
 *
 * **`connect` used to write the transport and not the method, and nothing said so.** The command
 * exists to make an agent able to do this, and it delivered one stdio entry — eight tools with no
 * instructions for composing a scene, pacing a narration, or the one rule that matters (every scene
 * length comes from measured word timestamps, never from a guess). An agent given the tools alone
 * improvises all of it, and the result looks like it. The gap was documented in `README.md` twice
 * before it was closed here, which was the wrong order: it cost 11 KB and one dependency to remove.
 *
 * **All three clients read `<client home>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`**, so one writer serves them and
 * only the client home differs. The defaults are `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and `~/.copilot`; each
 * client can move that home with its own environment variable, and the skill must move with the MCP
 * configuration or the agent gets tools without the instructions for using them.
 *
 * **The file is read out of `@xplainer/skill` rather than copied into this package.** There is one
 * reviewed `SKILL.md` and `packages/skill/src/build.test.ts` compares it byte-for-byte against both
 * bundles; a second copy inside `apps/cli` would be a third thing to keep in step and the first to
 * go stale. The dependency is data only — no code, no dependencies of its own, 11 KB over 12 files —
 * which is what makes it acceptable in payload 1's closure at all (root `AGENTS.md`: a new runtime
 * dependency here is a change to payload 1, the publish contract and every installer).
