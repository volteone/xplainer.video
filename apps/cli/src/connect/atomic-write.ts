/**
 * Replacing a file that belongs to somebody else's program, without ever leaving half of one.
 *
 * `connect` edits files **outside** the state directory: `~/.claude.json` holds a user's whole
 * Claude Code state, `~/.codex/config.toml` holds their whole Codex configuration, and Copilot's
 * `mcp-config.json` holds its user MCP servers. All may be read by a program that is running right
 * now. A truncate-then-write that is interrupted — a `SIGINT`, a full disk — leaves that program
 * with a file it cannot parse and a user with no obvious way back. So the new content is written
 * beside the target and `rename`d over it, which is atomic for any reader within the filesystem.
 *
 * This is deliberately **not** `daemon/durable-write.ts`. That module answers a different question —
 * "will this record survive the machine losing power" — and pays for the answer with two `fsync`s
 * and a forced `0600` mode on everything it writes. Here the file's mode is the *other* program's
 * decision and is preserved exactly; only a file this command creates gets a mode of its own, and it
 * is the restrictive one, because an agent configuration is a file the clients keep private.
