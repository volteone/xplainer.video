/**
 * The skill `connect` writes beside the MCP entry.
 *
 * **Asserted against the reviewed file rather than against a fixture**, because the whole value of
 * reading it out of `@xplainer/skill` is that there is one copy: a test with its own expected text
 * would pass while the shipped instructions drifted. `packages/skill/src/build.test.ts` compares
 * that same file against both plugin bundles, so this suite and that one pin the same bytes from
 * two directions.
 *
 * The re-run case is the one that matters in practice. `connect` is documented as re-runnable —
 * after an upgrade a user runs it again — and the point of writing the skill here is that one
 * command refreshes both halves. So a stale file must be replaced, and an identical one must be
 * reported as already current rather than rewritten, because "wrote" about a no-op is the kind of
 * sentence that makes a reader doubt the rest of the output.
